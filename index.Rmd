#### About Me

I am currently working as a Research Assistant at Lieber Institute of Brian Development in Data Science Team headed by Leonardo Collado-Torres. I hold dual master's degrees in Bioinformatics and  Materials Engineering from UIC, where I focused on bioinformatics analyses, particularly with protein structure prediction, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data. I've utilized tools like Seurat, Signac in R, and Scanpy in Python for data analysis. Currently I am learning about spatial transcriptomics and building computational pipelines.
